              WCD FAST SIMULATION

This code is currently just a repackaging of the EasySim code used in Auger.
It is based on EasySim v5r1 (July 2006).
In order to use it, please follow these simple instructions:

1) Installation

You just need ROOT (http://root.cern.ch/), installed and properly configured
(ROOTSYS set, ROOTSYS/bin in PATH...)

From the main dir, just enter:
make

Report any installation problem to bertou@gmail.com

2) Modifying geometry

The detector geometry is defined in src/Constants.h
To modify it, change the values STATION_RADIUS and STATION_HEIGHT, and the
number and position of PMTs (NPM X_PM and Y_PM). for example, our test tank
at Bariloche is:
const double STATION_RADIUS     = 0.7;  //(m)
const double STATION_HEIGHT     = 1.46;  //(m)
const int  NPM                  = 1;
const double X_PM[NPM]          = {0.};
const double Y_PM[NPM]          = {0.};

Then recompile (in main dir, run "make")

3) Running

Go to the data directory and edit the default.inp file. It is straightforward.
Be sure to be in CALIB mode (SHOWER mode is deactivated in this package).
Run it from the data directory:
make
It will provide a root file with a specific name depending on the parameters
defined in the default.inp file. It is then converted in ascii, extracting
the FADC traces, producing a .dat ascii file.
